You could read OSHA's **75-page** forklift safety regulations... or you could just check out this **quick hit list**:

## 🚦 1. Only trained & certified operators can drive a forklift (29 CFR 1910.178(l))

No training? No driving. OSHA requires **formal instruction, practical training, and evaluation** before an operator can get behind the wheel.

## 🔍 2. Forklifts must be inspected daily (29 CFR 1910.178(q)(7))

**Before each shift**, operators must check for issues like **brake problems, tire wear, or hydraulic leaks**. If something's wrong, **it needs to be fixed before use**.

## 📦 3. Load handling must follow safety protocols (29 CFR 1910.178(o))

Overloading = **bad idea**. Operators must keep loads **balanced, secured, and within weight limits**.

## 🚷 4. Pedestrian safety is a must (29 CFR 1910.178(n)(4))

Forklifts must have **horns, lights, and clear traffic routes** to avoid hitting workers on foot.

## 🔄 5. Refueling & battery charging must be done safely (29 CFR 1910.178(f))

No smoking, no open flames, and proper ventilation required.
