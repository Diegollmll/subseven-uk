        Let's face it—<strong>nobody likes paperwork</strong>. Especially when you're running a busy warehouse, a forklift training school, or just trying to keep your team OSHA-compliant <strong>without drowning in checklists and lost forms</strong>.

        <div className="ml-8 mb-4">
          Every forklift operator <strong>needs to perform a pre-shift inspection</strong>—that's OSHA law. But if your team is still using <strong>paper forms</strong> for this, you already know the struggle:

        <div className="ml-8 mb-4">
          <p className="text-red-400 mb-2">❌ <strong>Papers get lost.</strong></p>

          <p className="text-red-400 mb-4">❌ <strong>You don't know who actually did the checks.</strong></p>
          
          <p className="text-green-400 mb-4">✅ <strong>ForkU fixes this</strong> by giving every operator a <strong>simple, one-tap inspection checklist</strong> on their phone.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="ml-8">
          <p className="mb-2">• <strong>Operators scan their forklift QR code.</strong> 📲</p>

          <p>No messy forms. No excuses. And best of all? <strong>You have a digital record of every inspection in case OSHA comes knocking.</strong></p>
