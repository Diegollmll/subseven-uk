        <strong>Let's be real‚Äîforklifts are awesome.</strong> They lift heavy things, make work faster, and give operators a cool, almost superhero-like ability to move pallets with precision. But with great power comes great responsibility (and some pretty epic fails if you're not careful).

        Want to avoid an OSHA fine, a warehouse disaster, or becoming the next viral "forklift fail" video? Here are the <strong>top 5 forklift safety mistakes</strong> and how to fix them before your boss finds out.

          Sure, forklifts move fast, but they're not meant to drift Tokyo-style around corners. Speeding is one of the biggest causes of forklift accidents, and <strong>one wrong move can send your load flying or, worse, tip your forklift over</strong> (which is about as fun as it sounds).

            <li>Stick to the speed limits (yes, those warehouse signs aren't just decorations).</li>
            <li>Slow down when turning, especially with a load.</li>
            <li>If you have to hit the brakes hard, <strong>you're probably going too fast</strong> in the first place.</li>

        <div className="ml-8 mb-4">
          Think of your forklift like a car‚Äîif you never check the tires or fluids, <strong>one day it's going to let you down in a big way</strong>. Operators skipping daily inspections is a surefire way to <strong>turn a small issue into a giant (and expensive) problem</strong>.

          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
            <li>Do your pre-shift checklist (<strong>brakes, tires, hydraulics, seatbelt</strong>‚Äîall that good stuff).</li>
            <li>Report any issues immediately (because "hoping it fixes itself" is not a real solution).</li>

        <div className="ml-8 mb-4">
          Forklifts are <strong>built to lift</strong>, not to stack things in a wobbly game of "Will It Stay?" Loading pallets the wrong way <strong>leads to falling loads, damaged goods, and some very angry warehouse managers</strong>.

          <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Check weight limits</strong> (lifting more than your forklift's max is like trying to deadlift a car‚Äîit's not happening).</li>
            <li><strong>Balance your load</strong> so it's not leaning like a bad tower of pizza (yes, pizza).</li>
            <li><strong>Keep forks level</strong> while moving to prevent tipping.</li>

          Forklifts are <strong>one-seaters, not Uber rides</strong>. Letting someone hop on for a ride-along is a <strong>major safety violation</strong> (and a great way to get yourself fired).

          A warehouse without <strong>clear forklift traffic rules</strong> is like a busy intersection with no stoplights‚Äîchaos. Crashes between forklifts, pedestrians stepping into danger zones, and near-misses are all <strong>avoidable with some basic rules in place</strong>.

            <li>Always <strong>look before reversing</strong>‚Äîpedestrians don't have backup alarms, but you do.</li>
